**Introduction**
<br>
Our approach to cloud computing enables scalable, efficient, and cost-effective data processing, storage, and analysis. In this assignment, we have designed and implemented a comprehensive end-to-end data pipeline that extracts, transforms, queries, and visualizes data using cloud-native tools.
We initiated the process by extracting data from the GitHub API using a custom-built Python script that automates the collection of raw JSON data. We then transformed this data into CSV format to ensure compatibility with analytical tools, following a well-structured Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) paradigm that we developed.
To support large-scale data querying, we containerized the environment using Docker, where we set up and managed an instance of Apache Hive. Our implementation of Hive’s SQL-like syntax enables robust querying of large datasets, while Docker’s isolation ensures a consistent and reproducible development environment.
The final stage of our pipeline is visualization. We utilized Tableau to create interactive visual representations of query outputs, allowing users to explore and extract insights from the processed data. This step transforms raw data into actionable insights, making complex information accessible to a wider audience.
One of the key applications we focused on is analyzing Premier League football data. We processed and aggregated team performance metrics, such as win, loss, and draw percentages, and created visualizations that highlight performance trends for the top four teams. Our work offers valuable insights into team consistency, peak performance, and comparative analysis.
This project exemplifies our ability to harness cloud computing for large-scale data workflows. From custom API extraction to interactive visualization, each component of our pipeline demonstrates our expertise in cloud-native development, showcasing the practical application of modern data engineering principles.
